# logo-it

# Description
The motivation behind this was to build a logo generator so that developers could create logos without needing to spend money for a graphic designer. It is an easy process which can be done within the command line to quickly genrate a logo. There is a limit between three shapes (square, triangle, and circle) and three characters max.
